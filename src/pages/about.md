Hey, I'm Parin. Welcome to my corner of the internet—where I nerd out about AI, get philosophically enamoured sometimes, and try to make sense of things before they slip away.

This page comes in two parts: [the work stuff](#the-work-stuff) and [the human behind it](#the-human-behind-it). Feel free to skip to whichever interests you.

# The Work Stuff

I'm a freshman at Carnegie Mellon studying AI in the School of Computer Science. Currently, I'm a do research with [NeuLab](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~neulab/) under Professor Graham Neubig and Simran Khanuja, working on RAG-based entity linking for multilingual multimodal LLMs—basically helping AI systems understand cultural context across languages.

Before CMU, I was a Multimodal Research Scientist at SCB10X in Thailand, where I co-founded **Typhoon Vision**—Thailand's first Vision Multimodal Model. I've also done stints in synthetic data research at VISTEC and built production ML systems at Deep Capital.

In a prior life, I also helped teach AI to Thai people a the Artificial Intelligence Association of Thailand (AIAT) as a volunteer instructor. I taught workshops and also at conferences.

On the side, I'm a founding member of ScottyLabs' AI team, where we're building things like cmuGPT to make campus life a little less confusing for the 15,000+ students here.

I've been lucky enough to be mentored by [Dr. Peerat Limkonchotiwat](https://mrpeerat.github.io/) and published at ACL, EMNLP, and NeurIPS workshops on topics ranging from synthetic data generation to code-switching in medical translation. You can find my work on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1gbFjCwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

**I'm always open to collaboration**—research projects, hackathons, or just interesting conversations. If anything here resonates, please reach out. I mean it.

# The Human Behind It

I started this blog because we humans have such short lives. It's so easy to get swept away in the moment without actually *realizing* anything. This is my attempt to record, to reflect, to hold onto things before they disappear.

I'm from southern Thailand. I love nature deeply, despite spending most of my waking hours staring at terminals and training logs.

I've always loved fiction. You know the line—born too early to explore the stars, too late to explore the earth, just in time to possibly build our *AI overlords*. Books like *Red Rising*, *To Sleep in a Sea of Stars*, and *Unto Leviathan* keep that sense of wonder alive for me. Red Rising especially rekindled something, it also reminds me of my own life in ways I can't fully articulate.

Beyond fiction, I find myself drawn to thinkers like Naval Ravikant and Balaji Srinivasan. I also write fiction sometimes. That's all I'll say about that.

These days I'm training for a marathon. Making progress. Slowly.

## Why This Blog Exists

We humans have such short lives. It's terrifyingly easy to get swept away in the moment—chasing deadlines, optimizing metrics, shipping features—without ever stopping to actually *realize* anything. This blog is my attempt to record. To think out loud. To leave breadcrumbs for my future self and maybe, just maybe, say something useful to someone else along the way.

You'll find a mix of everything here: technical deep-dives into AI research, half-baked philosophical musings, book thoughts, and whatever else I'm obsessing over at the moment.

## Let's Talk!!!

Thanks for reading this far!

I'm genuinely excited about collaboration of all kinds—research projects, hackathons, building cool things, or just interesting conversations. Especially the conversations. If something here resonated, or you want advice, or you have an idea you think I'd find interesting, please reach out.

The best things in my life have come from people who decided to say hi. Maybe you're next.
